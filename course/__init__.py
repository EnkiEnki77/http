# http is the most popular protocol for exchanging data across the internet.

# A protocol is a set of rules agreed upon between computers across the world that then allow computers to
# communicate across the internet.

# A URL (uniform resource locator) is the address of another computer or resource on the internet. Part of the URL
# specifies how to reach the server, and part of it tells the server what resource we want.

# In order to utilize http to request data from a server we need to supply a URL that specifies the server, and
# what data we're wanting.
