# Our computer is connected to the internet, a network of millions of other computers also connected to the
# internet.
# When we want to communicate with one of the other computers over the network we specify the computer through
# its IP address aka web address.
# Each computer has it's own unique IP address, that allows other computers to directly communicate with it.

# The anatomy of an IP address is four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. For example 17.244.27.199.
# This format of IP is called IPv4

# There's also IPv6 which has 8 numbers separated by colons :. There are way more possible IPv6 addresses.
