without https your http messages are simly in plain text. This includes things like password or
credit card info.

we need https so that we can encrypt sensitive data being exchanged between a client and server.

using https http messages are sent in an encrypted form, using TLS protocol. Transport Layer Security.

just like with http, the browser first establishes a TCP connection with the server through a three way
handshake

next, a TLS handshake (certificate check) must be commenced. The browser sends a Client Hello to the server
this message tells the server things such as what TLS version it supports
